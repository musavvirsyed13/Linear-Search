    <h1>Linear Search</h1>
    <h1>Linear search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element
        of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.</h1>
    <h2>Assume that item is in an array in random order and we have to find an item. Then the only way to search for a
        target item is, to begin with, the first position and compare it to the target. If the item is at the same, we
        will return the position of the current item. Otherwise, we will move to the next position. If we arrive at the
        last position of an array and still can not find the target, we return -1. This is called the Linear search or
        Sequential search.</h2>
